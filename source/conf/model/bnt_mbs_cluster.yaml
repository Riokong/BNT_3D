# Configuration for BNT with Cluster-Guided Multi-Block Supervision

# Model name
name: BrainNetworkTransformer_MBS_Cluster

# Architecture (SAME as baseline BNT)
sizes: [360, 100]              # Adjust if your data has 200 ROIs
pooling: [false, true]          # Layer 0: no pooling, Layer 1: pooling
orthogonal: true                # Orthogonal cluster centers
freeze_center: true             # Freeze cluster centers during training
project_assignment: true        # Projection-based assignment

# Positional encoding
pos_encoding: none              # Options: 'identity' or 'none'
pos_embed_dim: 360              # Not used when pos_encoding=none

# Cluster-guided supervision (NEW)
supervised_layers: [0]          # Supervise layer 0 with layer 1 cluster centers
